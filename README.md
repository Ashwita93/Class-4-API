## Week 4: Building API's/Building Harry Potter Characters List

This week we were tasked to follow the last weeks slides and class work/workbook which was to build our own API's using node.js and then creating a client side interface to get, post, delete the endpoints. 

However, since the topic is quiet extensive and I decided to follow one of the references - Dan Shiffman's videos on building an API using Node (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Upi9TMrBk&t=1s) which was shared in the assignment's guide. I ended up following the video and build the code similar to how Dan does in the video and understood a lot of concepts that I wasn't a 100% sure on. 

However, when I tried to follow the workbook, I was confused with some of the instructions and was getting few errors. 

So currently, This is what I have managed to achieve. 
1. I have the respository of all the data shown when I navigate to http://localhost:3000/all. The path needs to be /all
2. If I wish to add more data to the JSON file, I can do it via http://localhost:3000/add/(the character's name)/(the house they belong to). For Example http://localhost:3000/add/Harry Potter/Gryffindor
3. If I wish to search to see if the data exists I can do it via http://localhost:3000/search/(Character's Name). For Example, http://localhost:3000/search/Harry Potter
